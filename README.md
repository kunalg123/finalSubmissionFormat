## About Ngspice 
Ngspice is an open source mixed-signal circuit simulator.

### Installing Ngspice

#### For Ubuntu

Open your terminal and type the following to install Ngspice
```
$  sudo apt-get install -y ngspice
```

## Running the Simulation


To enter the Ngspice Shell, open the terminal & type:
```
$ ngspice
```
To simulate a netlist, type:
```
ngspice 1 ->  source <filename>.cir
```

You can exit from the Ngspice Shell by typing:
```
ngspice 1 ->  exit
```
 <p align="center"> or </p>
 
```
ngspice 1 ->  quit

## Future Work

1. Improved matching techniques such as Common Centroid / Interdigitisation need to be implemented while laying out the current mirror.
2. PNR for the designed circuit is yet to performed using the Open Source Tool provided by the OpenROAD project.
3. Corner Analysis Testing of the bandgap reference circuit is yet to be performed.
4. The load driving capability needs to be improved by addition of a buffer block such as an OTA or a common drain amplifier.
5. To adjust the reference voltage resistors must be trimmed using fuses, hence, resistor trimming must be employed in the circuit.
6. The design must be improved to provide a higher PSRR.
7. In the future an OTA based bandgap reference circuit will be developed with improved performance characteristics. Also, a second order bandgap reference will be studied and developed, to improve the temperature coefficient.
8. To solve the problem of unwanted parasitic BJTs being extracted due to the modification made in the Technology File.
